# Metal-Detector
A simple metal detector project using a HMC5883L magnetic field sensor (on the GY-86 module) with Raspberry Pi. After powering on, press a button to start detection. As a metal object approaches the sensor, up to 4 LEDs light up to indicate proximityâ€”more LEDs mean the object is closer.
